# Calcora

(A fun personal tool which I decided to commit to and turn into something good and useable for everyone because why not.)
Calcora is an open-source, self-hosted computational mathematics engine designed to provide symbolic and numerical solutions with transparent, step-by-step reasoning. Unlike cloud-based tools, Calcora runs entirely on your own machine, making it ideal for classrooms, research, and privacy-conscious users.

**Status**: v0.2-alpha - Now with **Integration** support! Academic adoption features in active development.

## 🎯 Vision: Academic Adoption

Calcora aims to become the preferred computational tool for universities, STEM students, and researchers. We're building a transparent, educational alternative to WolframAlpha that emphasizes:
- **Step-by-step explanations** that help students learn
- **Open-source transparency** for research reproducibility
- **Zero cost** for educational institutions
- **Offline-first** for privacy and accessibility

**Phase 1 Features** (v0.2): Integration, Series Expansion, Limits, LaTeX Export, Equation Solving

See our [Academic Strategy Document](ACADEMIC_STRATEGY.md) for the complete roadmap.

- **Partial Fractions** - For rational functions
- **Trigonometric Identities** - For trig combinations
- **Numerical Fallback** - For non-elementary integrals

#### **Test Results** ✅
All 29 comprehensive tests passed (100% success rate):
- Polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic
- Rational functions, inverse trig, hyperbolic functions

- Complex products requiring advanced techniques

See [INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md](INTEGRATION_FEATURES.md) for complete details.

### 🎯 Usage Examples

#### Indefinite Integral:
```python
from calcora.integration_engine import IntegrationEngine

engine = IntegrationEngine()
result = engine.integrate("x**2", variable="x", generate_graph=True)
# Output: x**3/3 + C
# Graph: Shows parabola f(x) = x² and cubic F(x) = x³/3
```

#### Definite Integral with Area:
```python
result = engine.integrate("x**2", variable="x", lower_limit=0, upper_limit=1)
# Output: 1/3 ≈ 0.333333
# Graph: Shows shaded area under parabola from 0 to 1
```

#### Complex Expression:
```python
result = engine.integrate("x * exp(x)")
# Output: (x - 1)·e^x + C
# Technique: Integration by parts
# Graph: Both functions plotted with clear relationship
```

### Coming Soon
- **Series Expansion**: Taylor and Maclaurin series
- **Limits**: Symbolic limit computation
- **LaTeX Export**: Export results as publication-ready LaTeX
- **Equation Solving**: Solve algebraic and transcendental equations

## Install

### Quick Start (Clone & Run)

**New to the project? Follow the step-by-step guide: [CLONE_AND_RUN.md](CLONE_AND_RUN.md)**

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+ and Git

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dumbo-programmer/calcora.git
cd calcora

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install Calcora with dependencies
pip install -e ".[engine-sympy,cli,api]"

# 5. Test installation (optional but recommended)

### Building Standalone Executables (Windows)

Want to share Calcora without requiring Python? Build standalone executables:

```powershell
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build both CLI and server executables
.\build.ps1 all

# Executables are in dist/
.\dist\calcora.exe differentiate "x**2"
.\dist\calcora-server.exe  # Opens browser automatically

# Create distribution package
.\package.ps1
# Creates: dist/calcora-{version}-windows-x64.zip
```

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed build and distribution instructions.

### Self-Hosting the Web UI

Run your own Calcora web server:

```bash
# Development mode (auto-reload)
uvicorn calcora.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Production mode
uvicorn calcora.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

Access from any device on your network at `http://YOUR-IP:8000/static/index.html`

For complete deployment guide (cloud platforms, Docker, systemd, etc.), see [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

### Docker (Coming Soon)

```bash
docker compose up
```

Docker deployment is on the roadmap for v0.2.

## Architecture (short)

Calcora represents computation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of **StepNodes**. Each step records:

- operation name
- applied rule
- input expression
- output expression
- human-readable explanation
- dependencies on prior steps

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the formal model.

### Supported operations (v0.1)

**Differentiation**:
- Constants and identity: d/dx(c) = 0, d/dx(x) = 1
- Sum rule: d/dx(f+g) = f' + g'
- Constant multiple: d/dx(c·f) = c·f'
- Product rule: d/dx(f·g) = f·g' + g·f'
- Power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n·x^(n-1) (with chain rule)
- Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot (with chain rule)
- Exponential and logarithmic: exp(u), log(u) (with chain rule)
- Inverse trigonometric: asin(u), acos(u), atan(u) (with chain rule)
- SymPy fallback for complex expressions

**Linear Algebra**:
- Matrix multiplication
- Determinants (2×2, 3×3, general)
- Matrix inverse
- Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- LU decomposition
- **Symbolic matrices**: Variables as entries (e.g., [["a","b"],["c","d"]])

All operations include step-by-step explanations with multiple verbosity levels.

## Plugins

Calcora supports three plugin types:

- **Rule plugins**: symbolic transformations that emit StepNodes
- **Solver plugins**: algorithmic / numeric solvers (root finding, etc.)
- **Renderer plugins**: text, LaTeX, JSON, and future visualization

See [docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md).
