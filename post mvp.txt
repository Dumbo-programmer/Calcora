Calcora: Post-MVP Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

Think in phases, not features.

🟢 Phase 1: MVP Stabilization (Weeks 5–8)
🎯 Goal

Turn Calcora from “works” → people can rely on it

What to do

Testing

Unit tests for symbolic ops

Regression tests for known expressions

Error handling

Friendly math errors (not stack traces)

Performance sanity

Cache repeated subexpressions

🟡 Phase 2: Step-by-Step Engine v2 (Core Differentiator)
🎯 Goal

Make Calcora educationally superior to Wolfram Alpha

Expand step system

Move from “pretty text” → formal reasoning graph

Example internal structure:

{
  "operation": "differentiate",
  "rule": "chain_rule",
  "input": "sin(x^2)",
  "output": "2x cos(x^2)",
  "explanation": "Derivative of sin(u) is cos(u)·u'"
}

Add:

Rule tagging (product, chain, substitution)

Optional verbosity levels:

concise

detailed

teacher-mode

Why this is huge

You’re building a math explanation engine

This is rare, even commercially

Metrics unlocked

👨‍🏫 Teachers using Calcora

🧑‍🎓 Classroom adoption

🟠 Phase 3: Topic Expansion (Careful & Selective)
🎯 Goal

Broaden usefulness without bloating

Add only high-value topics

Pick 3–4 max:

🧮 Linear Algebra

Matrix multiplication

Determinants

Gaussian elimination (step-by-step!)

📊 Graph Theory

BFS / DFS

Dijkstra

Adjacency & Laplacian matrices

🔢 Numerical Methods

Newton–Raphson

Root finding

Approximation methods

Why this matters

Expands user base (CS + math + physics)

Connects to olympiad & contests

Metrics unlocked

📦 CLI downloads

🧠 Advanced users

🔵 Phase 4: Self-Hosting Excellence
🎯 Goal

Make Calcora easy to deploy anywhere

Features

Docker Compose

Configurable compute limits

Multi-user support (optional)

Offline mode guarantee

Add:

“Run Calcora on a school server”

“Run Calcora on Raspberry Pi”

Why admissions care

Real-world systems thinking

Infrastructure knowledge

Metrics unlocked

🖥️ Server installs

🏫 Institutional usage

🟣 Phase 5: Extensibility (Developer Magnet)
🎯 Goal

Turn Calcora into a platform

Plugin system

New rules = new plugin

Custom solvers

Language bindings

Example:

@calcora_rule
def implicit_diff(expr):
    ...

Why this is powerful

Others contribute

Open-source legitimacy

👥 Contributors

🔴 Phase 6: Visualization & Insight
🎯 Goal

Go beyond text

Add:

Expression trees

Graph plots

Step graphs

Matrix heatmaps

This pairs beautifully with step-by-step reasoning.

🟤 Phase 7: Research & Advanced Features (Optional, Elite Tier)

Only if you’re comfortable:

Proof outlines (not full proofs)

Dimensional analysis

Symbolic simplification strategies

Error propagation

This screams future researcher.

📈 How this maps to an ECA timeline
Grade	Calcora Stage
9–10	MVP + Phase 1
10–11	Step engine + expansion
11–12	Platform + adoption
🧾 Final ECA phrasing (example)

Founder of Calcora, an open-source, self-hosted computational mathematics platform providing symbolic and numerical solutions with step-by-step reasoning. Led design of a rule-based explanation engine, implemented 25+ algorithms, and deployed Calcora for student and classroom use, reaching X users across Y countries.

This is exactly what elite STEM ECAs look like.
